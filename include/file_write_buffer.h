/**
 * @brief Creates a new I/O ring buffer.
 *
 * This function allocates a large, contiguous block of memory to serve as a
 * thread-safe, circular buffer for decoupling the real-time pipeline from
 * the disk writer.
 *
 * @param capacity The total size of the buffer in bytes. A large size (e.g., 1GB)
 *                 is recommended to absorb significant I/O latency spikes.
 * @return A pointer to the new FileWriteBuffer, or NULL on memory allocation failure.

 *
 * This is a NON-BLOCKING call. It is designed to be called from a real-time
 * thread. If the buffer does not have enough free space to write all the
 * requested bytes, it will write as much as it can and return immediately.
 *
 * @param iob The I/O buffer.
 * @param data A pointer to the data to be written.
 * @param bytes The number of bytes to write.
 * @return The number of bytes actually written to the buffer. If this value is
 *         less than 'bytes', it indicates a buffer overrun has occurred.

 * the end-of-stream or a shutdown is signaled.
 *
 * @param iob The I/O buffer.
 * @param buffer A pointer to a local buffer to read the data into.
 * @param max_bytes The maximum number of bytes to read (typically the size of 'buffer').
 * @return The number of bytes actually read. Returns 0 if the end of the stream
 *         is reached and the buffer is empty, or if a shutdown is signaled.
