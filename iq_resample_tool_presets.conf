# Preset Configuration File for the I/Q Resampling Tool
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
#
# 1. This file allows you to define custom presets for common resampling tasks.
# 2. To define a new preset, create a new section like [preset:your-preset-name].
#    The 'your-preset-name' is what you will use with the --preset option.
# 3. Inside each section, add key = value pairs to define the preset's behavior.
# 4. Lines starting with '#' or ';' are comments and are ignored.
# 5. The program will look for this file in its current directory at startup.
#
# --- AVAILABLE KEYS ---
#
# description          = (Required) A short, one-line description of the preset.
#                        This text is shown when you run the program with --help.
#
# target_rate          = (Required) The final output sample rate in Hz.
#                        You can use scientific notation (e.g., 2.4e6 for 2.4 MHz).
#
# sample_format_name   = (Required) The output sample format. Must be one of:
#                          cs16 : Signed 16-bit complex I/Q
#                          cu8  : Unsigned 8-bit complex I/Q
#                          cs8  : Signed 8-bit complex I/Q (for raw output only)
#
# output_type          = (Required) The output container format. Must be one of:
#                          raw      : Headerless I/Q data, for piping to other tools.
#                          wav      : Standard WAV file (max 4GB).
#                          wav-rf64 : RF64/BW64 WAV file for large recordings.

# --- Example Presets for NRSC5 Decoding ---

[preset:cu8-nrsc5]
description = Sets sample type to cu8, rate to 1488375.0 Hz for FM/AM NRSC5 decoding (produces headerless raw output).
target_rate = 1488375.0
sample_format_name = cu8
output_type = raw

[preset:cs16-fm-nrsc5]
description = Sets sample type to cs16, rate to 744187.5 Hz for FM NRSC5 decoding (produces headerless raw output).
target_rate = 744187.5
sample_format_name = cs16
output_type = raw

[preset:cs16-am-nrsc5]
description = Sets sample type to cs16, rate to 46511.71875 Hz for AM NRSC5 decoding (produces headerless raw output).
target_rate = 46511.71875
sample_format_name = cs16
output_type = raw


# --- Example of a User-Defined Preset ---
#
# Let's say you frequently resample for a specific WFM broadcast receiver
# that requires 240k sps with 16-bit samples in a standard WAV file.
# You could add the following preset by uncommenting the lines below:

; [preset:wfm-240k]
; description = Standard 240 ksps I/Q for WFM broadcast analysis.
; target_rate = 240000
; sample_format_name = cs16
; output_type = wav
